You are tasked with building “InnovHub,” a web-based student innovation ecosystem designed to foster original project development, cross-functional collaboration, and effective use of Google Technologies within a college environment.

The platform must be both practical for daily student use and showcase technical innovation aligned with Google’s stack.

📌 Core Features Required
✅ AI-Powered Project Idea Generator

Input: Student provides keywords, interests, or domain (e.g., “sustainability,” “health-tech”).

Output: Gemini API suggests 3–5 unique project ideas with brief descriptions and architecture hints.

✅ Skill-to-Project Matchmaking

Input: Student lists their technical/non-technical skills.

Output: Gemini AI recommends suitable projects needing those skills.

✅ Live Project Help Board

Students post real-time requests like “Need frontend developer” or “Looking for IoT hardware support.”

Others can view and offer to join projects needing their expertise.

✅ AI Blueprint Generator

Gemini API provides rough system architecture diagrams and recommended tech stack (Firebase, GCP, etc.) based on selected project ideas.

✅ Project Showcase & Collaboration Space

Each project has a public page with title, description, team members, repo link, tech tags, and project status.

Peers can comment, star, and request to join teams.

✅ Google Tech Badges System

Projects integrating Google tools (e.g., Firebase, Gemini AI) earn visible platform badges, encouraging adoption.

✅ Success Stories & Alumni Project Archive

Library of impactful past projects with images, videos, tech stack details—includes projects like “Smart Solar Ecosystem.”

✅ Low-Code Starter Templates for Beginners

Preloaded, customizable Firebase Studio + IDX templates to help non-expert users quickly prototype apps or websites.

✅ Mini Hackathon Integration

Option to organize campus-only, 24–48 hour project sprints directly through the platform, boosting real project creation.

🛠️ Tech Stack Guidelines
Frontend: Google IDX for development

Backend & Database: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Storage)

AI Services: Gemini API (for ideas, blueprints), Vertex AI (mentor recommendations, skill analysis)

Additional Tools: Firebase Studio for project templates, Google Calendar API for event scheduling

🎯 Target Outcome
A prototype website with 2–3 fully functional features from above list.

User flow should prioritize: easy onboarding, AI-assisted suggestions, seamless project collaboration.

Platform must visibly promote innovation and Google tool integration, making it engaging and beneficial for all students, including beginners.

InnovHub is not just a project listing site—it’s an intelligent ecosystem empowering students to create, collaborate, and innovate using the best of Google technologies.
